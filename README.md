# Jarvis

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Jarvis is not offical launched, we as developer will try our best to release soon... But you have early access use following steps.

It is my **3rd year university project**. So, it for educational purpose. but, we might release in near future, if we see a good progress and user response.

It's an Digital AI Assistant made in python. That can help you do your daily task and keep productive.

## Great Thank You 

A great thank you & shout out to [@razorblade23](https://github.com/razorblade23) for creating [PyCrucible](https://github.com/razorblade23/PyCrucible). It help a lot in bundling the python app to an executable for convenience.

Also great thank you to [@JeelDobariya38](https://github.com/JeelDobariya38) for guide me to improve my code quality and for suggesting newer ideas for this project.
